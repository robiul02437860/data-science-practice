    "The left y-axis corresponds to the number of home runs.\n",

    "This scatter plot shows the relationship between a baseball player's age (on the x-axis) and their salary (on the y-axis). Each point represents an individual player’s salary at a specific age.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Observations:**\n",
    "1. **Correlation (0.33):**\n",
    "* The correlation value of 0.33 indicates a positive but moderate relationship between age and salary.\n",
    "*   This means that, generally, as players get older, their salaries increase, but the relationship is not very strong. Other factors beyond age (such as performance, experience, team contracts, etc.) also play a significant role in determining salaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Peak Salary Age:\n",
    "*   The graph shows that salaries peak around the ages of 30 to 35. This is the period when most players are at their prime in terms of experience, physical condition, and performance.\n",
    "*   Players tend to reach their highest earning potential around this age range due to long-term contracts, endorsements, and their established value within teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Salary Decline After Age 35:**\n",
    "*   After the age of 35, the number of players earning high salaries begins to decline. This is expected, as players usually start to decline in performance and physical capability in their later years.\n",
    "*   Fewer players in the 40+ age group command the same high salaries, although some high-performing veterans might still be exceptions.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Low Salaries for Younger Players:**\n",
    "*   Players below the age of 25 generally have lower salaries, as they are often newer to the league and still proving themselves. Entry-level contracts or minor league players in their early years may also contribute to this trend.\n",
    "*   As players gain experience and prove their worth, their salaries tend to rise, as shown by the upward trend into the 30–35 age range.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Outliers:**\n",
    "*   There are a few players in their late 20s and early 30s earning extremely high salaries (above $30 million), which are outliers. These could be star players with exceptional contracts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Insights:**\n",
    "* Salaries increase with age up to a certain point (around 30–35 years), which is typically when players reach their peak performance.\n",
    "* After this peak, salaries decline as players age, aligning with the natural decline in physical ability and performance.\n",
    "* The positive correlation (0.33) suggests that age is one of several factors influencing player salaries, but it is not the only determinant."
